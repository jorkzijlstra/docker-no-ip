# docker-noip

This is a simple Docker container for running the [No-IP2](http://www.noip.com/) dynamic DNS update script. It will keep
your domain.ddns.net DNS alias up-to-date as your home IP changes.

## Codebase
The codebase used for this image can be found here: [https://github.com/jorkzijlstra/docker-no-ip](https://github.com/jorkzijlstra/docker-no-ip)

It has been inspired on the [https://hub.docker.com/r/coppit/no-ip(https://hub.docker.com/r/coppit/no-ip) image which is only avaiable for the amd64 architecture.

## Image
This image has been build by using docker buildx. by default this uses a tagging schema of adding a DIGEST postfix after the version for each of the architectures.

F.i. for the ARM64 architecture you have to use the image `jorkzijlstra/docker-noip:latest@sha256:be7c51d0a803fff40ec897b7c601b9b4251b2a84ec1fbe01e53c0c5d5d9bdc38`
